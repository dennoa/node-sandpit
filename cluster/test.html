    <p>This makes a number of concurrent requests to /hi/{i}, each to be handled by one of the workers.</p>
    <p>Each time a request is made for this page, the worker process that served the page is scheduled for termination so that subsequent requests will be serviced
       by different workers. Once all of the workers have been terminated, the master process will stop.</p>
    <p>Use the throng example (node using-throng) which will respawn new workers following termination.</p>
